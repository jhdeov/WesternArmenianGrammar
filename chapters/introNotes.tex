Word Order vs. Inflectional vs. Agglutinative (Turkish)

Sneaky presence of Classical Armenian

hasmig: Your words (descriptive, factual, and clear) have brought up another issue that should be well-articulated in the introduction. This grammar is developed according to the principles of the science of language, linguistics. No prescription allowed. Believe it or not, this is a distinction that a lot of people are not aware of. I was looking at a couple of reviews of Dum-Tragut's book and they emphatically point out that it is based on modern linguistics. Perhaps we should have a subtitle to that effect.

lisa's issues with teaching


Lisa Gulessarian gave me her list of grammatical issues that challenge learners:

1)  Word order
2)  ինք vs ան
3)  խմ-ած vs խմ-եր 
4) the aorist -- both the irregularity and when to use it as opposed to the imperfect
5) conditionals
6) instrumental infinitive eg, երգալով կը գալէին
