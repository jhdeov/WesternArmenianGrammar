# WesternArmenianGrammar
This is in-progress [grammar](main.pdf) on Western Armenian, written by Hossep Dolatian and Michele Sigler. The current draft has the bulk of the phonology, with notes on things to add.

Because writing this grammar will take years, I figured it was practical to have an online copy around while we continue to write.
